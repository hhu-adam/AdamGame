Title "Triple"

Introduction
"
An equivalence `α : A ≃ B` between `A` and `B` consists of a pair of functions `f : A → B` and `g : B → A` such that `f ∘ g = id` and `g ∘ f = id`.

`finTwoArrowEquiv` constructs an equivalence between functions from `Fin 2` to `A` and pairs of elements of `A`, that is an equivalence
  ```
  (Fin 2 → A) ≃ A × A

  ```
In this level you construct an equivalence between functions from `Fin 3` to `A` and triples of elements of `A`.
