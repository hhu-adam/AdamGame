Title "Preimage of the inverse"

Introduction
"

The image of a set `S : Set A` along a  function `f : A → B` is the set of all elements
`b : B` that are the image of some element `a : A` in `S`. We denote it by `f '' S` and
define it as below.
```
f '' S = {b : B | ∃ a : A, a ∈ S ∧ f a = b}
```

Note that an element of the image is a triple `⟨b, a, h⟩` where `b` is the image of `a` and `h`
is the proof that `a` is in `S` and `f a = b`.

The image of function with a left in
verse is a subset of the preimage of the inverse of
the same subset.
